# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization | Internship Task 04

This project involves analyzing a real-world traffic accident dataset from Kaggle. The objective was to identify patterns and uncover insights related to road safety by visualizing various factors contributing to accidents. The notebook includes multiple visualizations covering different conditions and accident types.

## 🎯 Task Objective

Explore and analyze a traffic accident dataset to:

- Identify trends based on **road surface conditions**, **weather conditions**, **time of day**, **lighting conditions**, **crash types**, and **intersection involvement**.
- Visualize accident "hotspots" based on these factors.
- Practice data cleaning, multi-dimensional analysis, and effective data visualization techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Name:** `traffic_accidents.csv` from Kaggle
  
**Includes columns such as:**

- Roadway surface condition
- Weather condition
- Crash hour and day of week
- Lighting condition
- Crash type
- Intersection-related flag
- Injury details and contributory factors

## ⚡ What I Did

- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Checked data structure, column names, and handled missing or "unknown" values
- Analyzed accident patterns across multiple dimensions (surface, weather, time, lighting, type, intersection)
- Created clear, informative bar plots and count plots to highlight key patterns and accident "hotspots"
- Printed and summarized top categories for each factor

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools:** Python, Google Colab

**Libraries Used:**

- `pandas` – data manipulation and cleaning
- `matplotlib` – basic plotting and visualization
- `seaborn` – advanced and statistical plots
- `plotly` *(optional, for interactive maps if coordinates available)*

## 💡 Outcome

- Improved data cleaning and preprocessing skills, including handling "unknown" and missing data
- Strengthened exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data storytelling abilities
- Learned to identify risk patterns using multi-dimensional analysis
- Gained experience creating professional, publication-ready visualizations

## 🔎 Key Insights

- Road and weather conditions significantly influence accident occurrence
- Accidents peak during certain hours and under specific lighting conditions
- Intersection-related accidents show distinct patterns compared to non-intersection crashes
